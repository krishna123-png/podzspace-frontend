# podzspace-frontend

Frontend for the Podcast Studio Marketplace.

This repository is intentionally minimal so you can create a GitHub Codespace. Application code (React + Vite) will be added in subsequent commits.

## Planned Stack
- React (Vite), React Router, normal CSS
- Integrates with Studio API for search, schedules, and bookings
